This the repository for my personal landing page, version 4.

The website is built using:

- [expo](https://expo.dev/)
  - expo's main claim to fame may be mobile development, but it's more than competent at building websites. And I don't need to switch stacks.
- [Material Design Community Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/)
  - Still the only constant between various versions of my website.
- [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/)
  - Keeping my content as markdown allows for portability.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  - Namely [Fira Sans](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/)
