I'm a fullstack/mobile developer hacking on [Keet](https://keet.io/) at [Holepunch üï≥Ô∏èü•ä](https://holepunch.to/). On my own time I have several projects I'm working on, however none of my current projects are ready for daylight yet. I'm also an opportunistic contributor to Open Source projects - if I run into a bug that no-one's fixing, and it's within my capabilities, I'll send over a pull request.

Before üï≥Ô∏èü•ä, I've mostly coded as a hobby. I did work as fullstack developer for a few months, hacking on ticket (re)sale platform based on microservice architecture at Ticombo GmbH, but I didn't quite enjoy it, both because of company culture, and technical reasons.

Other than that I've been doing odd jobs to survive, while investing my time in my hobbies. I picked up some technical know-how working as a consultant/branch manager at a radio shop ([UAB Erksa](http://www.erksa.lt/Lt/)), and I had unpleasantly close look at USA's healthcare system at [R1-RCM (then Intermedix)](https://www.r1rcm.com/) as Accounts Receivable specialist. I've also worked as a freelance developer for a while, completing a few proprietary, private, small-to-medium, software projects, but it's much more fun to work on Open Source, even if it means joining a company (üï≥Ô∏èü•ä).

I've been coding for around a decade, maybe a little more. In this time I picked up various skills. I can write code in C, C++, Kotlin, Swift, and Python. However I feel most at home with Javascript/Typescript. I can also hack something together with Java and Objective-C, but I really rather don't. These languages can't die fast enough. I don't know a single scripting language, but somehow I keep cobbling together working scripts in Bash, Groovy, and long ago, AutoHotKey.

Among other skills I picked up, in no particular order:

- Extensive knowledge of P2P concepts and related technologies
- Familiarity with Bluetooth APIs
- Deep familiarity with Gtk toolkit
- Writing native extension for Javascript projects
- Natural language processing
- Mobile development (React-Native/Native)
- Web development, preferably with a modern framework (Angular/React)
- Cross-Platform development and code sharing
- Managing remote servers
- API design
- Cryptography
- HID hardware interfaces
- Advanced Regular Expressions
- Operating System integrations

I'm familiar with all major operating systems, primarily working on a MacBook Pro, tho I'd rather work with Linux (work sort of requires MacOS). Familiar doesn't mean I'm willing to work in Microsoft Windows environment. Supporting it is one thing, but half the tools used in development have issues on Windows. On mobile side I have no preference between Android and iOS, as I use both daily.

To finish up, I will not commute to an office. Fixed hours, fixed location, and so on, and so forth, don't suit me. I'm very satisfied working remotely, and in fact I've only worked remotely since I started coding professionally.

Even tho I'm employed full time, if you have an interesting idea, or fledgling project, I could consider joining your team part time. Shoot me an email and we can discuss.
