## Show Your Love!

If you'd like to support my projects and open source development, you'll find donation options below.
Every little bit helps.

While I work for an open source company, development outside of work takes a lot of time.
*My free time*.
To justify this, and to offset development costs (yes, there are costs), I ask you to consider a donation. You can sponsor me on [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/OzymandiasTheGreat) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ozymandias), or if you'd prefer a one time donation and above options don't suit you, you can make a donation through [DonorBox](https://donorbox.org/tomasrav-open-source-development).
