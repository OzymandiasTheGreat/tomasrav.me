I'm a freelance developer with over 6 years of experience,
occasionally an unwilling systems administrator (Linux), and I've also worked as
translator for English/Lithuanian.

My interest primarily revolve around Open Source and Linux, however
I do have some experience in the Windows world such as developing with Windows C API.

After several years as a self-taught coder, I decided to turn this
hobby into carrier.

With Unemployment bureau financing I took the opportunity to acquire
formal education in Java and been working freelance since.

I'm quick learner, for example picking up Angular in couple of weeks, since a job required it (I probably could've done it faster
if I wasn't also working on the back-end).

I'm always looking for new projects and opportunities to learn,
so don't hesitate to contact me if you have an offer.

### Languages

- Lithuanian, my mother tongue.
- English, I do more reading than speaking though, so my pronunciation is sometimes a bit off.
- Russian, I supposedly learned it in school, but I'm re-learning again now. I have decent comprehension, but speaking is rather hard.

### Programming Languages

- AutoHotKey (AHK), my first programming language.
- Python. When I switched to Linux, I learned it first thing.
- C. Not very fluent, but I occasionally need it for use with Python.
- Javascript and Typescript. I prefer the latter, but I'm fluent in both.
- Java. Intermediate. I have to say after all I'd rather work with other languages.
- HTML, quite fluent, prefer semantic tags.
- CSS, SASS. Fluent, but there are always new tricks to learn.
- Groovy. Same as Java, rarely used.
