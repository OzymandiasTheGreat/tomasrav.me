# Tomas Ravinskas

I am a freelance developer, occasional systems administrator, and formerly an
English/Lithuanian translator.

As a developer, I primarily focus on Open-Source and cross-platform experience. I do most of my work with React Native,
however, I'm just as capable with plain React and Angular.

When the need arises, I'm capable of binding native code for
improved performance and extra functionality.

I can develop across desktop, mobile, and web.
However, I have no experience with Apple platforms as I have no Apple devices. I'm looking forward to rectifying this via virtualization, as I recently learned I could run macOS on KVM.

I do all my work on Linux, both as a development platform and
my servers also run it. I am deeply familiar with Windows, though
I haven't used it extensively since version 7.

On the mobile side, it's Android for me. I'm both a long-time user and an Android developer. I prefer not to work with Java as much as possible that's why I chose TypeScript as my programming language. When I need more functionality than TypeScript offers, I turn to C/C++ to implement it.

As a systems admin, I'm hardly an expert, but I can competently
perform basic administration tasks.

As a translator, I'm most familiar with technical and legal terminology. In the last years of high school and shortly afterward, I made a living translating technical texts for college students (Lithuanian to English).

## Natural Languages

My native tongue is Lithuanian. However, I've been using English daily, most written,
since high school. Russian, I supposedly learned in high school too, but as I had no opportunities
to use it, I'm barely able to speak it. I'm making an effort to improve my Russian, though.

Language | Skill | Rating

üá∫üá∏ English (American) | Near-native | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
üá∑üá∫ Russian | Beginner | ‚≠ê‚≠ê

## Education

I don't have a college degree, as I am mostly self-taught. I did take a 6-month course on Java in a vocational school. Funded by Unemployment Bureau, I thought it was a superb opportunity to learn a language I don't like and found troublesome.
