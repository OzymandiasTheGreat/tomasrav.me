I wanted my library, [macpy](https://github.com/OzymandiasTheGreat/macpy), to run on all Linux systems,
including those using Wayland display server.

To do that I wrote bindings for Wayland input component
libinput. However libinput is a big project and
maintaining semi-official bindings proved too much
for me.

I hope someone steps up to take over this project.
