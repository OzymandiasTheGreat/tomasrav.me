I use SVGs in most of my projects but working with them
in InkScape is rather painful. So I wrote my own SVG
editor in TypeScript and Angular.

That wasn't a such a good idea, as Angular's
performance is rather poor on it's own and coupled with
complex documents to render... It's slow and laggy.

I hope I can find the time to rewrite this in a more
performant framework like React, or perhaps Vue.
