A virtual keyboard allowing to type emoji into any
application directly.

See, Linux does not have a standard way to enter emoji.
In fact, until recently, most Linux applications didn't
even display color emoji.

There are many tools to make entering emoji easier,
but most of them consist of menu to select emoji and
copy it to clipboard. Then you also have to paste it.

This two-step process seemed like much to me, so I
wrote this app to allow typing emoji directly.
Many people agreed with me and the app got quite popular. It is, in fact, my most popular project.
