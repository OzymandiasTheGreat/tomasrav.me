[Mopidy](https://mopidy.com/) is a server-side headless music player
that allows you to hook up audio system to your server and stream music
from popular services like Spotify and YouTube.

ginger is a Mopidy client allowing you to control
Mopidy playback through a pretty and convenient
interface. It runs everywhere a web browser runs.
There's also a native Android app.

I named it ginger (all lower-case) because I come from
a family of gingers.
