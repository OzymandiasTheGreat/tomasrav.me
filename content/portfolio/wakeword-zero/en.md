My version of a personal wakeword system based on
[this article](https://medium.com/snips-ai/machine-learning-on-voice-a-gentle-introduction-with-snips-personal-wake-word-detector-133bd6fb568e)

I'm not the first to implement this system, but my
version runs absolutely everywhere through the power
of Web Assembly.
