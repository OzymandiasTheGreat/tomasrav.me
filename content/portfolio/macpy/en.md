I've been using AutoHotKey, an easy to use scripting
language for Windows automation, for years. However,
when I switched to Linux, there wasn't anything like
it.

Now writing a whole scripting language seemed a bit
much, so I wrote a library allowing similar
functionality for the programming language I already
knew. That's how macpy was born.

It allows hooking system input events, as well as
emulating them. This allows complete programmatic
control of any graphical or textual interface.

The name is a combination of [py]thon and [mac]ro, as
well as a play on magpie.
