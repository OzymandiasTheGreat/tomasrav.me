Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient calculator. Small
and fast, written in C. I bound a couple of established
C libraries and produced a WASM library that's easy to
use from TypeScript/JavaScript and run anywhere.

I needed this for [wakeword-zero](https://github.com/OzymandiasTheGreat/wakeword-zero)
