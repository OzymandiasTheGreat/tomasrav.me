[Mopidy](https://mopidy.com/) is a server-side headless music player
that allows you to hook up audio system to your server and stream music
from popular services like Spotify and YouTube.

[Mopidy-YTMusic](https://mopidy.com/ext/ytmusic/) is an extension I wrote for
Mopidy to allow streaming from Google's Play Music replacement [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/).

It started as a personal project, since I'm a YouTube Music subscriber, but
since I released it as Open-Source, a small community gathered around it.
It is now much more advanced than I ever intended to make it, but that's a good thing!
