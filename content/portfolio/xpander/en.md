[TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/) is popular
macOS app allowing to define text macros that expand
to much longer blocks of predefined text. It has many
features, such as dynamic variables, placeholders, and
so on.

Now I never used it, since I don't have a Mac, but I
found the idea to be very neat, so I wrote my own
version implementing most of the functionality for
Linux.

Alas, it's a niche app for niche operating system,
so it's never got quite popular.
