Mozilla's pdf.js is a library to render and parse PDF
documents in javascript. It powers Firefox's built-in
PDF viewer, along with many other apps and projects.

I forked it to make run natively on Android via React
Native or NativeScript. The port is complete and
functional, although not very performant.
